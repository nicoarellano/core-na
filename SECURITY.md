# Security Policy  


## Responsible Disclosure  

Collab Digital Twins (CDT) follows a **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** process to ensure security risks are addressed responsibly.  

By reporting security vulnerabilities through the responsible channels, you agree to:  
- Not disclose details of the vulnerability publicly until CDT has had a reasonable opportunity to fix it.  
- Provide CDT with adequate time to assess and mitigate the risk.  
- Act in good faith and follow ethical security research principles.  

CDT reserves the right to take necessary action against unauthorised or harmful security testing activities.

## Reporting Security Issues  

Collab Digital Twins takes security seriously and encourages responsible reporting of vulnerabilities.  

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, **please do not report it publicly**. Instead, follow the steps below to disclose the issue responsibly.  

### **How to Report a Security Issue**  

1. **Do not open a public issue on GitHub.** Instead, report security concerns via email to:  
   📧 **security@canadadigitaltwin.org**  
2. **Provide detailed information about the vulnerability**, including:  
   - A clear description of the issue.  
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.  
   - Potential impact or risk level.  
   - Any suggested mitigation strategies.  
3. **Allow time for assessment and response.** CDT will review the report and respond within **10 business days** to acknowledge receipt.  
4. **Cooperate with CDT to validate and address the issue.**  

Once a resolution has been identified, CDT may choose to:  
- **Release a patch** as part of the next scheduled update.  
- **Issue a security advisory** if the issue is critical.  
- **Provide acknowledgments** where appropriate (subject to CDT’s disclosure policy).

## Scope  

This security policy applies to:  
- All CDT repositories released as open source.  
- Code, configuration files, and infrastructure deployed as part of CDT’s platform.  
- **Third-party dependencies** included within CDT repositories. If you identify a vulnerability in a third-party component that CDT relies on (e.g., outdated libraries or known security flaws in dependencies), we encourage you to report it.  

Out of scope:  
- Issues related to third-party services or software **not used within CDT repositories**.  
- Vulnerabilities in user environments that are unrelated to this repository.  
- Unsolicited security testing or penetration testing without CDT’s explicit permission.  

---

## Security Best Practices  

To help maintain security across CDT repositories, we follow these principles:  
- Dependencies are **scanned and updated regularly** (e.g., using automated tools such as Dependabot).  
- Sensitive credentials **must not be included** in public repositories.  
- Security patches are applied in a timely manner, with priority given to critical vulnerabilities.
